Over time, Ms. Diamond had manipulated old chain link fencing welds in the exercise yard. She removed her clothing and was able to fit her small frame through the fence. Once out, she stole a nearby parked truck with trailer attached. She then forcibly rammed the vehicle through the gate to get onto the roadway. Deputies followed the vehicle toward Harkrider St., north on a local access road, and onto Robins St. The vehicle collided with electrical cables and came to rest. Ms. Diamond exited the vehicle and was captured on foot. Deputies secured medical assistance for Ms. Diamond for injuries sustained during the escape, and she was transported back to Unit 2. As a result of the escape, Ms. Diamond has accrued the following new charges: Second Degree Escape (Class B Felony), Theft of Motor Vehicle- Truck (Class B Felony), Theft of Motor Vehicle- Excavator (Class B Felony), Theft of Property- Trailer (Class C Felony), Criminal Mischief Second Degree for damage to the truck, trailer, and gate (Class D Felony), and Criminal Mischief Second Degree for damage to the power pole and meter (Class A Misdemeanor).

When deputies attempted to stop the vehicle, the driver, later identified as Jerimy Gadberry, did not slow down or stop. Mr. Gadberry continued westbound for several miles and used the oncoming traffic lane to pass several other vehicles. Several vehicles were forced to move over in an effort to avoid being struck by Mr. Gadberry.\u00a0 Mr. Gadberry continued at speeds between 85-90mph. Once Mr. Gadberry approached Skunk Hollow Rd., he locked up his brakes in an attempt to get deputies to collide with him. He then increased speed at the intersection of Highway 286. He continued traveling at high speeds through three parking lots of local businesses with workers present, swerved to avoid a light pole, and continued southbound down Drillers Dr., jumping Highway 286 without slowing or checking for traffic.\u00a0 Deputies caught back up with Mr. Gadberry at Caney Creek Rd and Amity Rd, where he blew through a stop sign and wrecked his vehicle while attempting to turn onto Betty Lane. Mr. Gadberry crawled over his passenger and attempted to exit the passenger side window. Deputies successfully took Mr. Gadberry into custody at this time, but he began banging his head on the window of the patrol vehicle. After being cleared by medical personnel, he was transported to Faulkner County Detention Center Unit 2. He remains housed with no bond on felony charges of Fleeing and Aggravated Assault, additional misdemeanor charges, and an Extradition Hold from Colorado."

U.S. Marshals attempted to make contact with Mr. Phillips in the attic, identifying themselves and advising him to come down. When Mr. Phillips failed to respond, deputies and officers entered the attic. Mr. Phillips immediately began resisting arrest and fighting with the deputies and officers, and he unsuccessfully attempted to remove the taser from one of the officers. At that time, deputies were able to detain Mr. Phillips. Mr. Phillips is currently housed in the Faulkner County Detention Center on the following charges: Aggravated Residential Burglary (Class Y Felony), Possession of Firearms by Certain Persons (2 Counts Class D Felonies, 1 Count Class B Felony), Possession of a Defaced Firearm (Class D Felony), 3rd degree Domestic Battery (Class D Felony), 1st Degree Terroristic Threatening (Class D Felony), Fleeing- Vehicle or Conveyance (Class A Misdemeanor), Fleeing- On Foot (Class C Misdemeanor), Theft by Receiving (Class D Felony), Resisting Arrest (Class A Misdemeanor).
