# Welcome!

This is the GitHub home for the [Police Data Accessibility Project](https://pdap.io). We're assembling a toolkit and space for shared resources. People all over the country use these resources to collect public records about the U.S. criminal legal system.

This repository is also a guide to the countless ways we use scraper code to access data. ([What do we mean by web scraper?](https://docs.pdap.io/activities/terms-and-definitions))

> Note: This repo is a work in progress, especially the structure of its utilities. Trust what you read here!

# How to run a scraper
Right now, this requires some Python knowledge and patience. We're in the early stages: there's no automated scraper farm or fancy GUI yet. Scrapers can be run locally as needed.

1. [Install Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cYmpfZEZ8r-09Q6Go917cKVcQk_d0P61gm0q8DAdIdg/). Prefer a differently opinionated guide? Perhaps [this](https://chrisamico.com/blog/2023-01-14/python-setup/) is more your speed.
2. [Clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Find the scraper you wish to run. These are sorted geographically, so start by looking in `/scrapers/...`.
4. Follow the instructions in the scraper's `README` to get going. **(If it's broken or simply out of date, please open an issue in this repo or submit a PR.)**

## Sharing back to the PDAP community

If you do something cool or interesting or fun with your shiny new data, share that in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). Want to kick around an idea or share something that doesn't work as expected? Discord's a great place for that, too.

# How to contribute
To write a scraper, start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Be sure to check out the [/utils folder](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/tree/main/utils/)!
