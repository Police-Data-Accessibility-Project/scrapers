# Welcome!

This is the GitHub home for web scraping at the [Police Data Accessibility Project](https://pdap.io).

[(What do we mean by web scraping?)](https://docs.pdap.io/activities/terms-and-definitions)

## How PDAP works
This repo is part of a toolkit for people all over the country to learn about our police systems. Check out our [software development roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/21/views/2) and [docs](https://docs.pdap.io) to learn more about our ecosystem.

# How to run a scraper
Right now, this requires some Python knowledge and patience. We're in the early stages: there's no automated scraper farm or fancy GUI yet. Scrapers can be run locally as needed.

1. [Install Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cYmpfZEZ8r-09Q6Go917cKVcQk_d0P61gm0q8DAdIdg/). Prefer a differently opinionated guide? Perhaps [this](https://chrisamico.com/blog/2023-01-14/python-setup/) is more your speed.
2. [Clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Find the scraper you wish to run. These are sorted geographically, so start by looking in `/scrapers_library/...`.
4. Follow the instructions in the scraper's `README` to get going. **(If it's broken or simply out of date, please open an issue in this repo or submit a PR.)**

## Sharing back to the PDAP community

If you do something cool or interesting or fun with your shiny new data, share that in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). Want to kick around an idea or share something that doesn't work as expected? Discord's a great place for that, too.

# How to contribute
To write a scraper, start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Be sure to check out the [/utils folder](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/tree/main/utils/)!

For everything else, start with [docs.pdap.io](https://docs.pdap.io/).

## Resources

[Here are some potentially useful tools](https://docs.pdap.io/tools/resources). If you want to make additions or updates, you can edit the docs in GitHub!
